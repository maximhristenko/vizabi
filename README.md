##What is Vizabi?

Gapminder Vizabi is a framework for developing visual exploration tools.

The main features are:

1. Embeddable tools with customization
2. Responsive layout
3. Support for UI Controls & Interaction
4. Translation & Localization
5. Unified data-schema for multi dimensional statistics.

You can use Vizabi to create a new visualization based on your data or modify our set of vizualization tools.
